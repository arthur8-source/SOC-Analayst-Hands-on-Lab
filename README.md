# SOC-Analayst-Hands on-Lab

# Advanced SOC Analyst Lab with LimaCharlie

## Introduction
Welcome to my Advanced SOC Analyst Lab, a hands-on cybersecurity project designed to simulate a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using [LimaCharlie](https://limacharlie.io/), a free-tier Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. Inspired by the practical, execution-focused approach of the "So You Want to Be a SOC Analyst?" course ([link](https://ddi.sh/sywtbsa)), this project goes beyond theory to deliver a fully functional lab where I:
- Set up and running live attack simulations
- Use EDR solutions to detect adversary actions
- Building and testing custom detection & blocking rules
- Analyzing telemetry from real malware and C2 frameworks
 This repository serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my readiness for a SOC analyst role, highlighting skills in threat simulation, EDR configuration, rule engineering, and data analysisâ€”all critical competencies sought by cybersecurity employers.

## Project Goals
- **Threat Simulation**: Replicate adversarial tactics (e.g., ransomware encryption, C2 beaconing) to understand attacker behavior.
- **Detection and Response**: Build and test precise detection rules and automated blocking actions in a live environment.
- **Telemetry Analysis**: Parse and visualize attack data to uncover patterns and validate response efficacy.
- **Professional Documentation**: Present the project in a clear, structured way suitable for technical review or interview discussions.

## Skills Showcased
- **Threat Simulation**: Crafted Python scripts to mimic ransomware and APT-style C2 persistence.
- **EDR Proficiency**: Configured LimaCharlie for real-time monitoring, detection, and response.
- **Rule Engineering**: Developed multi-condition YAML rules to catch subtle attack indicators while minimizing false positives.
- **Data Analysis**: Used Python to process JSON telemetry logs and generate an attack timeline graph.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deployed and secured Ubuntu VMs on AWS Free Tier for attack-and-defend scenarios.
- **Technical Communication**: Documented setup, execution, and findings in a concise, employer-friendly format.
